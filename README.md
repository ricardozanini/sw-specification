## About

Open Workflow Specification presents a vendor-neutral, open-source, and entirely community-driven ecosystem for defining and executing DSL-based workflows. 

The Open Workflow DSL is a high-level language that reshapes the terrain of workflow creation, boasting a design that is ubiquitous, intuitive, imperative, and fluent. 

Bid farewell to convoluted coding and platform dependencies—now, crafting powerful workflows is effortlessly within reach for everyone!

Key features:

- **Easy to Use**: Designed for universal understanding, Open Workflow DSL enables users to quickly grasp workflow concepts and create complex workflows effortlessly.
- **Event Driven**: Seamlessly integrate events into workflows with support for various formats, including CloudEvents, allowing for event-driven workflow architectures.
- **Service Oriented**: The Open Workflow DSL empowers developers to seamlessly integrate with service-oriented architectures, allowing them to define workflows that interact with various services over standard application protocols like HTTP, GRPC, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and more.
- **FaaS Centric**: Seamlessly invoke functions hosted on various platforms within workflows, promoting a function-as-a-service (FaaS) paradigm and enabling microservices architectures.
- **Timely**: Define timeouts for workflows and tasks to manage execution duration effectively.
- **Fault Tolerant**: Easily define error handling strategies to manage and recover from errors that may occur during workflow execution, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Schedulable**: Schedule workflows using CRON expressions or trigger them based on events, providing control over workflow execution timing.
- **Interoperable**: Integrates seamlessly with different services and resources.
- **Robust**: Offers features such as conditional branching, event handling, and looping constructs.
- **Scalable**: Promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability across different environments.

## Ecosystem

Open Workflow Specification ecosystem is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) and was approved as a
Cloud Native Sandbox level project on July 14, 2020.

It encompasses a comprehensive suite of components and tools designed to facilitate the creation, management, and execution of workflows. 

1. **[DSL](dsl.md) (Domain Specific Language)**: The core of the ecosystem, defining the fundamental syntax and semantics of the Open Workflow Specification.

2. **[CTK](/ctk/README.md) (Conformance Test Kit)**: A set of Gherkin features utilized for both conformance testing and Behavior Driven Design (BDD), ensuring compliance and facilitating testing across implementations.

3. **[SDKs](#sdks) (Software Development Kits)**: These enable developers to interact with workflows in various programming languages, providing functionalities such as reading, writing, building, and validating workflows.

4. **[Runtimes](#runtimes)**: Dedicated environments for executing workflows defined using the Open Workflow DSL, ensuring seamless deployment and operation within diverse runtime environments.

5. **[Tooling](#tooling)**: Additional utilities and resources tailored to enhance the development, debugging, and management of workflows, streamlining the workflow lifecycle from creation to deployment and maintenance.

### SDKs

The Open Workflow Specification SDKs are essential tools designed to assist developers in consuming, parsing, validating, and testing their workflows utilizing the Open Workflow DSL.

These SDKs empower developers to seamlessly integrate workflows into their applications, providing robust support for various programming languages. By offering comprehensive functionality, they streamline the development process and enhance workflow management.

Explore our SDKs for different programming languages:

- [.NET](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-net)
- [Go](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-java)
- [PHP](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-php)
- [Python](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-python)
